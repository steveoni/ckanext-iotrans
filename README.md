# ckanext-iotrans

This CKAN extension lets you convert datastore resources into files of various formats and, for spatial data, Coordinate Reference Systems.

This extension is intended for use cases that require download of datastore resources in multiple formats of Coordinate Reference Systems aside from CKAN's built in formats.

This extension leverages the [Fiona](https://pypi.org/project/Fiona/) Python library.

## Requirements

This extension only works if the [CKAN Datastore Extension](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/maintaining/datastore.html) is active

Compatibility with core CKAN versions:

| CKAN version    | Compatible?   |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| 2.6 and earlier | not tested    |
| 2.7             | not tested    |
| 2.8             | not tested    |
| 2.9             | yes    |

## Usage

ckanext-iotrans creates the following CKAN actions - both will only work for admin users:

### `to_file`

#### Inputs:

- **resource_id**: CKAN datastore resource ID

- **source_epsg**: source EPSG of resource ID, if data is spatial, as an integer

- **target_epsgs**: list of desired EPSGs of output files, if data is spatial, as integers

- **target_formats**: list of desired file formats as strings. ex: `["csv", "xml", "json"]`

| Spatial Formats | Non Spatial Formats   |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| CSV             | CSV           |
| GEOJSON         | JSON          |
| GPKG            | XML           |
| SHP             |               |

#### Outputs:

Writes desired files to folder in /tmp, and returns a list of filepaths where the outputs are stored on disk

### `prune`

#### Inputs:

- **path**: path to file or directory in `/tmp` to delete

#### Outputs:

Removes file or directory, as long as its in `/tmp` directory


## Details

### Memory and Disk Use

When running `to_file`, data is first streamed from the datastore into a `csv` stored on disk. All subsequent files created will be created from this "dump" file. When writing to new output files, content is streamed from the "dump" file into each output file (to reduce memory usage). Streaming from CKAN is done via multiple sequential calls to CKAN's `datastore_search` action.

Processing to convert files to another format, or transform coordinates from one Coordinate Reference System to another, are done in memory on one chunk of the data at a time - `ckanext-iotrans` never loads an entire file into memory.

### Geometric Data

`ckanext-iotrans` identifies spatial dataas anything containing a `geometry` attribute. A `geometry` attribute's value should be structured as follows:

```json
    "type": "Some Geometry Type",
    "coordinates": [X Coordinate, Y Coordinate]
```
So, for example:
```json
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-79.156501959987, 43.232603612123]
```

The following geometry types are currently accepted:
* Point
* LineString
* Polygon
* MultiPoint
* MultiLineString
* MultiPolygon

To avoid mixed geometry types in a single output file, all non-Multi geometry types are converted to their Multi counterparts (ex: Point to MultiPoint).

### Shapefiles

Shapefiles get treated differently than other file formats.

By default, shapefiles cannot have column names longer than 10 characters. To adapt to this, `ckanext-iotrans` will (for shapefiles with at least one column name longer than 10 characters) truncate each column name to its first 7 characters, and then concatenate to it an incrementing integer. The integer is added to maintain that all columns have unique names.

The mapping from the original filename to its newly truncated one in the output shapefile is stored in a `.txt` that is zipped inside the shapefile with the rest of its components.

For example:

| Input Column Name | Output Column Name   |
| ---------------   | ------------- |
| ID                | ID1           |
| LOCATION_NAME     | LOCATIO2      |
| LOCATION_ID       | LOCATIO3      |

### `pre-commit`
This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

To set up:
```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
pre-commit install
```
Usage:
- after you've installed pre-commit, the next time you `git commit` the list of installed pre-commit hooks (defined in `.pre-commit.yaml`) will run to auto-format files and check for other things.
- A log of hooks that succeeded and failed will be printed
- Normally a few will 'fail' which typically just means some rules of the hook were broken (e.g. a file in the diff had trailing whitepace)
- Most often, the hooks defined for this repo will automatically fix these issues: running `git status` should then show some newly-unstaged changes which resulted from the pre-commit hooks modifying files (eg. autoformatting)
- if an issue can't be automatically fixed by the installed hooks then you may need to fix it yourself before a commit is excepted
- pre-commit hooks can be bypassed with the `-n` flag: `git commit -n -m "some commit message"`. This should generally be avoided if possible (if a rule truly should be ignored consider using linting ingore comments, eg `# noqa:<flake8_rule_id>
